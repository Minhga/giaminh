            " This might be an unpopular opinion but I think memes are supposed to spread out and give laughs just like when you tell people jokes, the source doesn’t matter but what important is it gave others a laugh. Do we credit people anytime we do a knock knock joke? A pick up line? No. If we are concerned that they are having much more views and likes because of our meme then, that’s so sad. We shouldn’t be centering our achievements/value with such things. I make memes myself occasionally and I don’t really mind if I don’t get credited for it as long as it makes more people happy. Stealing is not ok for things such as art theft since people are making a living out of it. But memes is a different case, If they wanted to they just appear and introduce themselves. Or when netizens tracked them down. I’m just saying the best things are free such as laughter which these memes bring. "
